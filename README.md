OVERVIEW

Hursty's GPi Themes RetroPie Downloader

I have made a few themes for GPi case, so I decided to create my own ES Themes downloader and just list my themes linked directly to my Github repositories.  This allows easier access to my themes for everyone.


The ES bootup randomizer script was created by David Marti for his Motion Blue Unified base image.

Periodically, new themes are completed and you will need to run the script updater to download the newest version to see these additional themes.

The instructions below will demonstrate how to install the script and have it show up in the RetroPie menu within Emulation Station.

-------
INSTALLATION - using a Raspberry Pi build of RetroPie

Exit out of Emulation Station by pressing F4 (or remote into the Pi using something like Putty)

Type the following commands and press enter after each line to execute it:

***wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RetroHursty69/HurstyGPiThemes/master/install.sh***

***chmod +x "install.sh"***

***./install.sh***

This will download and install the Hursty's GPi Theme script and update the RetroPie ES gamelist.xml file.

Restart Emulation Station and you should then see the new script in the RetroPie menu.
